"Department of the Air Force Civilian Compensation and Benefits
How Five Mission Critical and Hard-to-Fill Occupations Compare to the Private Sector and Key Federal Agencies","What constraints does the Air Force operate under in comparison with compensation and benefit structures found in other federal agencies and the private sector?
How does Air Force compensation for select hard-to-fill or mission critical occupations compare with that offered in other federal agencies and the private sector?
What can be done to improve the competitiveness of the Air Force's compensation and benefits packages to better recruit and retain top-tier civilian talent?
","The U.S. Department of the Air Force has approximately 200,000 civilian employees working in 600 different occupations and professions. This includes approximately 170,000 appropriated fund civilians and more than 16,000 civilian employees who work in specialized research facilities and laboratories in 22 different locations across the United States.A critical tool in recruiting and retaining top-tier civilian talent is the compensation and benefits package offered. However, a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office found that the competitiveness of federal wages in general varies widely depending on educational attainment.
The Air Force Directorate of Civilian Force Management asked Project AIR FORCE to conduct a study to help address concerns regarding the Air Force's ability to compete with private-sector compensation and benefits, particularly for hard-to-fill and mission critical occupations (MCOs). This report documents the constraints the Air Force must operate under in comparison with compensation and benefit structures found in other federal agencies and the private sector. It provides recommendations to improve the competitiveness of Air Force compensation and benefits packages to better recruit and retain top-tier civilian talent.
Given the large number of civilian occupations within the Air Force, the authors focus specifically on five occupational fields identified as priorities because they are either designated as mission critical or are particularly hard to fill: Aircraft Operations, Air Traffic Control, Human Resources Management, Information Technology Management (Cyber), and Aircraft Mechanic.
","	The Air Force has not yet developed internal standardized written procedures for determining mission critical occupations.
	For several occupations, current Office of Personnel Management classification and/or qualification standards do not reflect the current operational environment or job demands.
	For several occupations, current Air Force pay is significantly lower than that in the private sector. However, there is often substantial variation between the state level and the locality pay area level, which needs to be taken into account when hiring in local labor markets.
	The use of recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives varies across installations, and their use depends on the availability of local base or activity funds.
	The Air Force's use of special salary rates is critical in trying to close the pay gap between the Air Force and the private sector, but statutory pay caps hinder this approach.
	Job vacancy announcements often include boilerplate language, provide wide ranges of pay grades and associated salary levels, and lack mission and culture statements.
	Air Force personnel covered by pay band systems have the potential to receive higher pay, and that might assist in recruiting and retaining mission critical personnel.
","	Develop a policy and approach for determining and addressing mission critical occupations (MCOs).
	Explore whether special salary rates need to be established or updated for MCOs and hard-to-fill occupations and localities.
	Establish Air Force-level data collection standards and an analysis plan for incentive use and examine the feasibility of establishing central funding for recruiting, retention, and relocation incentives and permanent change of station for MCOs and hard-to-fill occupations.
	Update vacancy announcements to ensure that they are more applicant friendly and that they provide more specific, accurate, and enticing information about compensation and benefits.
	Establish Air Force-wide communities of practice for recruiting and retaining personnel from MCOs and hard-to-fill occupations.
	Use Transition Assistance Programs to help fill jobs.
	In coordination with DoD, petition the Office of Personnel Management to review classification and qualification standards and to update them as necessary to reflect current Air Force occupational requirements.
	Explore the potential implications of raising the salary pay cap for aircraft operations and air traffic controller positions, which require higher special salary rates. This would require legislative action.
	Pursue the ability of the Air Force to establish and use pay bands for MCOs or hard-to-fill occupations. This would require legislative action.

The Air War Against the Islamic State The Role of Airpower in Operation Inherent Resolve,"What happened during the air campaign against ISIS?
How was airpower employed?
Was airpower effective against different ISIS target sets?
What did airpower accomplish in or contribute to the defeat of ISIS?
What lessons should the U.S. Air Force and joint force derive from this campaign?
","Airpower played a pivotal role in the U.S.-led fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from 2014 to 2019 and contributed to the success of Operation Inherent Resolve. This report sheds light on the impact of the air operations in Operation Inherent Resolve and whether airpower could have been applied differently to achieve faster, more-sustainable outcomes. The authors incorporate interviews with U.S. and coalition personnel, primary-source documents, and U.S. and coalition strike and sortie data to document the operational history of the air war, assess the relationship between airpower effects, and analyze the strategic and operational impact of airpower in Operation Inherent Resolve.
The authors find that, although airpower played an essential role in combating ISIS, airpower alone would not have been likely to defeat the militant organization. Instead, the combination of airpower and ground forces—led by Iraqi and Syrian partners—was needed to destroy the Islamic State as a territorial entity. The overarching strategy of Operation Inherent Resolve, which put ground-force partners in the lead, created several challenges and innovations in the application of airpower, which have implications for future air wars. To be prepared to meet future demands against nonstate and near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Air Force and the joint force should apply lessons learned from Operation Inherent Resolve.
","	Airpower played a critical role in Operation Inherent Resolve, based on the ""by, with, and through"" strategy, which placed local partners as leaders of the fight to destroy the caliphate. In turn, partners' capabilities and interests shaped how airpower was used.
	Although more-aggressive air operations might have slightly accelerated the defeat of ISIS, they are unlikely to have significantly altered the timeline.
	The deep fight in Operation Inherent Resolve affected ISIS's finances, but it could not affect ISIS's main center of gravity—territory—meaning that strategic attack did not play a decisive role in this operation.
	Critical enablers, such as remotely piloted aircraft and aerial refueling aircraft, were in high demand and provided vital capabilities but were at times overstretched.
	Essential wartime skills, such as deliberate-targeting and defensive counterair operations, were used for the first time in years in a real operation, requiring reinvigoration of these proficiencies.
	Battlespace management within the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition was a point of disagreement, particularly between the Combined Joint Task Force Commander and the Combined Air Forces Component Commander, and affected the development of the deep fight.
	Necessary efforts to prevent civilian casualties and reduce collateral damage depleted precision-guided munition stockpiles.
","	The joint force should revise its targeting doctrine based on the experience in Operation Inherent Resolve, including potentially incorporating the strike cell construct into doctrine or determining whether to use the Joint Air Ground Integration Center to integrate airpower with ground partners in the absence of forward joint terminal attack controllers.
	The joint force should reinvigorate, reexamine, and revise the target-development process to make it more efficient.
	The joint force should modify the allocation process for high-demand assets in joint campaigns to reduce inefficiencies and increase agility.
	The joint force should reexamine battlespace management and revise doctrine or tactics, techniques, and procedures so that it can more dynamically manage both the close and the deep fights.
	The Air Force will need to limit civilian casualties and collateral damage, requiring it to allocate precision-guided munitions efficiently across theaters and identify how to safely use second- and third-choice munitions.
	The Air Force should continue to develop more targeteers and intelligence professionals to support a reinvigoration of the target-development process.
	Self-defense rules of engagement in air-to-air operations should be stressed to airmen in training and real-world flying events. Leaders should emphasize to airmen that they are empowered and expected to defend the airspace, while avoiding inadvertent escalation.

"Managing Risk in Globalized Supply Chains
","How can USAF develop a repeatable SCRM process to quickly identify, assess, prioritize, and mitigate supply chain risks that affect weapon system readiness?
What systemic challenges could prevent USAF from adopting a formal SCRM process?
","In recent years, policymakers have increased emphasis on national security risks deriving from globalization of weapon system supply chains to include foreign suppliers. This report recommends specific ways in which the U.S. Air Force (USAF) can evolve its organization, policy, training, and data practices to avoid and mitigate the effects of supply chain risk.
The authors reviewed academic literature on supply chain risk management (SCRM); analyzed federal, Department of Defense (DoD), and USAF policy and regulations related to supply chain management and acquisitions; and interviewed personnel from across USAF and DoD. They found that USAF SCRM is hampered by widely dispersed policies and responsibilities; challenges in identifying, acquiring, integrating, and analyzing SCRM-relevant data; overreliance on contractors to manage their own supply chain risks without sufficient incentives; and insufficient SCRM training for acquisition professionals.
Many coordinated actions have the potential help USAF address these SCRM weaknesses. An analytic organization to conduct centralized analyses that are beyond the scope of program offices may be helpful. Program offices may benefit from routinely collecting bills of materials and lists of associated suppliers and critical items from contractors; obtaining proper data rights; and considering the value of technical data packages to SCRM. A comprehensive plan to manage SCRM-relevant data collected throughout government may help USAF facilitate data integration and analysis. An ongoing, formal, enterprise-level SCRM curriculum to train acquisition professionals on supply chain risks may help USAF personnel consider such risks in source selection and other decisions.","	USAF policies and responsibilities for SCRM are widely dispersed, with limited alignment, coordination, and information-sharing.
	USAF places implicit and explicit trust in its vendors to manage their supply chain risks sufficiently to protect USAF from the effects of disruptions.
	SCRM analysts have a limited understanding of which suppliers are actually in the supply chain of a given program or weapon system beyond the first tier.
	Many sources of SCRM-relevant data exist but are in diverse formats and can be difficult to access, integrate, and analyze.
	The USAF acquisition workforce of 2020 has had limited on-the-job training and exposure to the full range of supply chain risks and how to collect sufficient information to understand them.
","	USAF, and DoD more broadly, may benefit from an executive SCRM council to establish policy, set standards, and facilitate information-sharing from across the enterprise. At a minimum, council membership would represent the acquisition, logistics, intelligence, counterintelligence, and operational user communities. A separate analytic organization within USAF could support the council's agenda.
	USAF acquisition policy may consider requiring programs that are strategically significant to consider supply risk as part of source selection.
	To gain insight into the lower-tier providers, some program offices could collect a complete list of raw materials, parts, and subcomponents and the associated suppliers needed to produce an end item (e.g., the bill of materials). To help prioritize SCRM activities, these program offices could also consider the value of requiring contractors to provide lists of items that can critically affect the reliability of contract end items (e.g., a critical items list).
	To reduce the burden on program offices and to facilitate supply chain risk assessment, DoD could develop a comprehensive plan to manage SCRM-relevant data collected throughout government that would include USAF logistics, maintenance, and safety programs. In the absence of a DoD-wide effort, USAF may wish to consider developing a resource for its own community.
	DoD may benefit from developing an ongoing, formal, enterprise-level SCRM curriculum that trains acquisition professionals on identifying and mitigating supply chain risk.

Fighter Basing Options to Improve Access to Advanced Training Ranges,"What squadron restationing and range upgrade policies maximize access to advanced training ranges?
What are the relative costs of range upgrades and squadron restationing?
What risks need to be taken into account when weighing range upgrades and squadron restationing?
","The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has determined that its fighter pilots do not currently have sufficient access to training ranges with airspace, threat emitters, targets, and electronic support measures capable of representing advanced potential adversaries. The USAF is developing a plan to upgrade certain ranges with these capabilities. In addition, the USAF may consider potential fighter squadron restationing options that would improve access to the upgraded training ranges.
The authors developed an optimization model to determine the combinations of range upgrades and squadron restationing options that provide the highest levels of effectiveness given different policy constraints. They developed one-time move costs associated with squadron restationing and compared those with preliminary range upgrade cost estimates. Finally, the authors collected data on the risks from natural hazards and power outages for the set of bases and ranges under consideration.
The authors found that range upgrades alone might not ensure sufficient access to advanced ranges and that restationing fighter squadrons can provide additional access, but the amount depends on institutional freedom to make restationing decisions. The one-time costs for restationing a fighter squadron and range modernization are on the same order of magnitude, but range upgrades may be substantially more expensive over the long term. The authors recommend that the USAF assess the effectiveness, costs, and risks of restationing presented in this report against other potential solutions for providing access to advanced ranges.
","Range upgrades alone provide only a portion of possible benefits, and restationing can significantly increase effectiveness
 The increase in effectiveness depends on which institutional policies the USAF is willing to change or manage. Most significantly, if Air National Guard squadrons cannot be consolidated near advanced training ranges, the potential benefits of restationing are substantially limited.
Using the current basing posture and planned range upgrades, the F-22 squadrons might not have access to advanced training ranges.
In the near term, the analysis suggests a large potential benefit from consolidating F-22 squadrons near an upgraded range.
The largest opportunity to improve readiness in the long term is integrating the range modernization plan and the F-35 rollout.
Range upgrades may be substantially more expensive over the long term
The one-time cost for restationing a fighter squadron and the cost to procure equipment for range modernization are on the same order of magnitude. However, when research and development and operation and sustainment costs are taken into account, range upgrades may be substantially more expensive over the long term.
The risk from hazards and threats could affect anticipated effectiveness or cost associated with particular basing decisions
There is significant variability in electric power reliability and exposure to natural hazards and climate effects across USAF fighter bases and ranges that might require different levels of investment to recover from or mitigate disruptions.
","	Prioritize upgrading a range near an F-22 base and consolidating F-22 squadrons. This would require a more-detailed analysis of airfield capacity issues, range capacity, and availability constraints.
	Coordinate the introduction of new F-35 squadrons, retirement of legacy aircraft, and range upgrades to ensure that F-35 squadrons would have range access at the earliest possible time.
	Develop a training strategy that outlines how much training would be required at each range capability level to better understand how much range capacity would be required, and then evaluate restationing against other potential solutions.
	Develop full life cycle cost estimates for range modernization to understand the number of ranges that would be affordable over the long term and how those costs would compare with the cost and institutional challenges of restationing squadrons.
	Collect and incorporate relevant risk data, such as hazard exposure maps, climate data, and electric power reliability metrics, in basing decisions.

"The Demand for Responsiveness in Past U.S. Military Operations
","What has been the level of responsiveness of the U.S. military in the ten cases examined?
What role, if any, has responsiveness played in achieving the U.S. military and political objectives?
How often was the joint force called on to respond to multiple contingencies simultaneously?
What recurring factors facilitated or inhibited rapid responses?
How responsive is airpower?
","The Department of Defense (DoD) argues that it needs to maintain a high level of readiness across the joint force so that it can remain highly responsive. In this report, the author conducts a historical analysis to identify the demand for responsiveness in past U.S. operations. This historical analysis demonstrates that U.S. forces have been called on to rapidly respond to crises many times since 1950 and that responsiveness was important—to varying degrees—to achieving the United States' political aims in all but one of the cases examined. Moreover, the U.S. military has routinely been called on to carry out multiple operations simultaneously. Going forward, the United States must consider the balance between readiness for smaller-scale crisis response operations and being prepared to deter and defeat a great power in major combat. It is not clear that the U.S. military can continue to try to do everything. This historical analysis cannot specify the exact level of readiness that the joint force should maintain. But it does suggest that the United States has demanded a relatively ready military since World War II and that if the American people and American policymakers continue to expect their military to be able to quickly respond to events anywhere in the world, maintaining a relatively high level of readiness will be necessary.","U.S. forces have been called on to rapidly respond to crises many times since 1950
Responsiveness was important—to varying degrees—to achieving the United States' political aims in all but one of the cases examined.
Quick reactions are often needed in response to unanticipated or out-of-the blue events, such as terrorist attacks and hijackings.
They are also important when the United States is seeking to deter aggression, prevent an opponent from rapidly achieving its objectives, and assist a partner or ally that is under attack.
Responsiveness tended to be less important when critical U.S. interests were not at stake but decisionmakers chose to use force as a coercive tool.
U.S. forces have proven quite responsive
U.S. forces typically had enough military capability in place to carry out the operation within weeks of the deployment order being issued.
Only in the instances of deterring or intervening in a major war did the U.S. require a large joint force and take months to mass the requisite forces.
Many recurring factors facilitated rapid responses, including having forward-based or deployed forces proximate to the area of operations, political decisiveness, prepared en route infrastructure, prepositioned equipment, agreed-upon base access, strategic airlift, and prepared contingency and deployment plans.
The absence of these factors hindered responsiveness.
Airpower has proven to be extremely responsive.

"Technology Innovation and the Future of Air Force Intelligence Analysis
Volume 2, Technical Analysis and Supporting Material
","Intelligence collections and demand have grown over the past two decades, and intelligence analysts are often performing routine tasks, leaving them unable to conduct larger strategic analyses that are needed to address future threats as outlined by the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of technologies that could help the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) become more effective, efficient, adept at using human capital, and agile. A key point is that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies alone do not solve these intelligence challenges; rather, if they are properly implemented and complemented by human analysts who have the right skills and training, the capabilities can allow the AF DCGS to evolve to better meet warfighter needs.
This is the second volume in a series about how AI/ML technology can help the AF DCGS meet the challenges of a demanding intelligence environment and the complexity of future threats envisioned by the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The authors provide more in-depth discussion of project methodology; a primer on AI/ML technology; case studies of analytic challenges in previous operations; best practices for successfully deploying new technologies; and other topics of interest to specialists, stakeholders, and experts.
","What are the near-term fixes to existing intelligence challenges?
Where could AI/ML be integrated into analytic processes in the coming years?
Going forward, how can the AF DCGS leverage investments of partner organizations?
How does the AF DCGS onboard new tools and technologies?
In general, how does the AF DCGS foster innovation?

"Technology Innovation and the Future of Air Force Intelligence Analysis
Volume 1, Findings and Recommendations
","There is growing demand for the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) to analyze sensor data. Getting the right intelligence to the right people at the right time is increasingly difficult as the amount of data grows and timelines shrink. The need to exploit all collections limits the ability of analysts to address higher-level intelligence problems. Current tools and databases do not facilitate access to needed information.
Air Force/A2 asked researchers at RAND Project AIR FORCE to analyze how new tools and technologies can help meet these demands, including how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be integrated into the analysis process. PAF assessed AF DCGS tools and processes, surveyed the state of the art in AI/ML methods, and examined best practices to encourage innovation and to incorporate new tools.
","What are the challenges within the current enterprise?
How can tools and technologies — including AI/ML methods, available today or in the foreseeable future — help the AF DCGS evolve to meet the challenges of synthesizing data effectively and efficiently?
How might AI/ML be used and how can it help lay out a road map for incorporating technologies as they become available?
","	Many analytic tasks can be fully or partially automated, although human involvement will continue to be necessary in more-complex tasks.
	AI/ML can free analysts to focus on solving intelligence problems and developing supporting technologies to make analysis more efficient.
	Analysts will require new skills both to facilitate use of AI/ML and to take advantage of opportunities to conduct more-advanced analysis.
","	AF DCGS should leverage existing technologies to automate some analysis and reporting tasks and to make archival intelligence more accessible.
	AF DCGS should take advantage of AI/ML technologies, when available, for early phase analysis tasks (e.g., identifying and tagging imagery, issuing threat warnings, re-tasking collectors).
	AF DCGS should organize to balance human effort across three competencies: supporting missions, supporting analysis, and solving intelligence problems.
	AF DCGS should recruit and train analysts with data science, programming, and other skills.
	AF DCGS should follow best practices for developing, implementing, and sustaining new tools.

"Regional Responses to U.S.-China Competition in the Indo-Pacific
","What factors might provide a rationale for increased cooperation between the United States and Indonesia in responding to China's more assertive behavior in the Indo-Pacific region?
What factors might mitigate expectations about Indonesia's willingness to take sides regarding U.S.-China competition?
How do Indonesia's formulators and implementers of security policy in the civilian and military spheres, as well as the broader public, view China, and how do they view Indonesia's potential relationship with a rising China?
","The U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD's) 2018 National Defense Strategy highlights the importance of working with regional allies and partners in order to manage China's rise as a strategic competitor to the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. In this country-level report in a series, the author examines the potential for, and potential impediments to, partnering more closely with Indonesia.
In many ways, Indonesia is a natural partner: Its self-defined core national security interests, including the preservation of its sovereignty against encroachment by any would-be hegemonic regional power, are in relatively close harmony with those of the United States. But U.S. planners must be keenly aware of the constraints on Indonesia's willingness and capacity to forge a partnership based on strategic competition with China. These constraints include persistent aversion to any partnership that might be characterized as ""alignment""; enduring antiforeign attitudes, particularly in military circles; strong desire to balance security engagement among the widest possible array of nations; deep and growing economic linkages with China; an institutional mindset for the military that is geared more toward internal stability than external defense; historical and ongoing underfunding of basic military needs; and a lack of military capability and interoperability sufficient for frictionless interaction with U.S. forces. Although Indonesia will remain an important U.S. partner, such challenges should moderate expectations about the pace for increased engagement.
","The United States and Indonesia share deep concern about China's ambitions for regional dominance and willingness to violate international norms in pursuit of these ambitions
Both states, however, would prefer a strategy that corrals China into compliance with global norms over one based on military confrontation.
Indonesia remains fiercely opposed to what its strategists term blocs
It is highly suspicious of the intentions of any foreign powers.
Indonesia regards China as its only realistic near-term military foe, with a specific potential for military confrontation over its Natuna Islands near the South China Sea
But because of the imbalance of military capabilities, as well as China's enormous economic leverage, Indonesia has very little appetite for military confrontation.
Many items in the U.S. playbook of security engagement will run into institutional barriers in Indonesia
These barriers include low levels of military funding, a security policymaking bureaucracy that is not designed for speedy decisions, and a tendency to make security policy on an ad hoc rather than a doctrinal basis.
","	The U.S. government should accept Indonesia's deep-seated desire for nonalignment. In practice, this means that the United States should refrain from actions that Indonesia is likely to interpret as forcing it into a de facto alliance: for example, pushing for high-profile advertising of security cooperation with the United States, when Indonesia might prefer greater rhetorical balance.
	The U.S. government should pay particular attention to consultation and protocol. In any meeting with U.S. counterparts, the ""deliverables"" for Indonesian interlocutors might include courtesy calls, official parades or displays, and any other displays of courtesy.
	The U.S. government should reexamine the legal issues surrounding crew lists. The United States, unlike most other nations, refuses to provide crew lists for U.S. Navy vessels in Indonesian ports.
	DoD and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) should increase emphasis on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), which Indonesian National Military doctrine describes as a core mission. HA/DR improves interoperability, does not impinge on Indonesia's nonaligned status, and lends itself to multilateral exercises.
	DoD and the USAF should enhance U.S.-Indonesia cooperation in the areas of cyber and electronic warfare. The Indonesian Army is now significantly ahead of its air force counterpart in the cyber arena, and this might be a useful area for USAF engagement.
	DoD and the USAF should encourage Indonesia to increase its presence in the Indo-Pacific region, including participation in multilateral air and maritime activities and conducting operations in the South China Sea—while being aware that such participation might be modest.

"Analysis of Global Management of Air Force War Reserve Materiel to Support Operations in Contested and Degraded Environments
","What do case studies and the literature reveal about the trade-offs and best practices for a centralized versus decentralized management approach?
Could the Air Force benefit from transitioning to a global management strategy for prepositioning WRM?
What processes, analytic capabilities, tools, and systems could the Air Force employ to improve global management of WRM?
","Because adversaries have developed capabilities that may restrict or deny U.S. forces' access to a given area, the operational environment of the future may be different from the environment that the U.S. military has been accustomed to over the past 30 years. Prepositioning select war reserve materiel (WRM) may help mitigate vulnerabilities associated with operating in a contested, degraded, or operationally limited environment. In this report, RAND researchers evaluate management approaches and global prepositioning strategies for WRM postures in such environments. They describe conditions under which global management practices are advantageous and then propose methods that a global manager of WRM could employ to improve support of air component operational warfighting demands. Specifically, the authors demonstrate ways to standardize and validate determination processes for WRM requirements, establish a WRM prioritization schema, relate WRM priority to positioning postures, analyze trade-offs through modeling, and assess partner-nation risk.","The Air Force's current system of WRM management is positioned more for efficiency than effectiveness
A decentralized management strategy facilitates a rapid response to changes in demand but can generate informational distortions, lead to cost inefficiencies, and promote organizational fragmentation. A more centralized management strategy promotes information-sharing, process standardization, and resilience of the supply chain to potential disruptions at the expense of time and a tailored solution.
The harsher environments expected in the future will likely create new risks and uncertainty for U.S. forces, and such environments may be better served through a centralized (global) management approach.
An Air Force global manager of WRM should globally manage capabilities, moving away from focusing on individual items (for example, generators, tents, and trucks) and toward discussing WRM capabilities (such as WRM needed to support the ability to receive forces at a base, project force, and recover the base) with a view toward effectiveness.
RAND researchers have developed several tools that could help a global manager of WRM better support strategic resiliency and responsiveness goals. These tools include the Lean Strategic Tool for the Analysis of Required Transportation, the Prepositioning Requirements Planning Optimization model, and the Strategic and Political Risk Assessment Tool.
","	A global manager of WRM should standardize and validate warfighter demands.
	The Air Force should move away from inventory management and toward capability management for mission support assets.
	The Air Force should develop a method to determine priority for WRM prepositioning.
	The Air Force should optimize its WRM prepositioning posture.
	The Air Force should consider political factors when analyzing WRM prepositioning strategies.
	The Air Force should adopt tools and metrics to measure readiness for mission support assets.
