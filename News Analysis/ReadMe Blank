In Resource Summary, you could get access to all the services (NLU, WKS…), and add new service or storage.
Watson Studio 
IBM cloud Pak for Data: https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/ 
Function: Create notebooks, Upload data, and connect to service such as NLU
Watson Knowledge Studio  (WKS)
Preparation
Create entity type system, dictionary, relation types and Upload them
Prepare documents to train 
Functions
Assets
Entity Types
Create the entity type (Organization, Person…) 
Or Upload by system file
Documents
Upload the document we want to analyze 
Relation Types 
Dictionaries
Upload using dictionary format
Machine Learning Model
Pre-annotation 
Dictionaries (where to see the results)
Machine learning models
NLU
Annotations
Annotation Task—>Add task
Create Annotation Sets (choose the documents you want to be manually annotated) and Select sets
Manually annotate—> Submit all (100% completed)—>accept (to ground truth)
Ground Truth: Watson use it to train the model on a new domain
Performance
Train and Evaluate
Statistics
Most commonly annotated mentions
Relations 
Coreference 
3 Primary evaluating statistics
Precision 
Fraction of machine learning annotator’s output that is correct 
Recall 
Fraction of correct annotations that ML annotators successfully captures
F1 score 
Weighted average of precision and recall 
Versions 
Create a version 
Deploy to Watson Discovery or NLU
Model Deployment Status (use Service instance ID)
